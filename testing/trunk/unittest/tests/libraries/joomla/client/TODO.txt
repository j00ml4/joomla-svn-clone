ftp.php
1	testSetOptions()
	Should we also test non-existing values, e.g. a string for the timeout?

2	this is a pretty "complex" test and should best become a TestSuite by
	its own (client/JFtp/AllTests.php) divided into separate testcases
	for each "feature", i.e.
	- connection
	- filesystem I/O
	- permissions
	- upload
	- download
	- ...
	Ideas?
