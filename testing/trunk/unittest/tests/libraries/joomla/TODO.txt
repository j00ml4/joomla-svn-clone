1	testGetXMLParser_feeds()
	# FIX in framework class:
	JFactory::getXMLParser('RSS') and JFactory::getXMLParser('Atom')
	called with empty $options array
		"Undefined index: rssUrl" factory.php line 265

	to avoid E_NOTICE, change line 265 to:
		if ( isset($options['rssUrl']) && (null !== $options['rssUrl']) )

3	testGetDBO()
	=> check workflow in getDBO() and see if MockObjects can help
	JFactory::getDBO() has many prerequisites which currently can't be
	(easily) satisfied in a *simple* test case, i.e.
	- 	JFactory::_createDBO() [the workhorse] expects JError to be available,
		which THIS test case is not in charge to take care of.
	- 	loading JError doesn't help since in this context
		-	will call customErrorPage()
		 ->	depends on $mainframe aka JSite's getTemplate()
		 ->	which will call JFactory::getDBO() for the template ...
