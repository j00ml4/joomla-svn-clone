=======
1	testSetOptions()
	Should we also test non-existing values, e.g. a string for the timeout?

2	this is a pretty "complex" test and should best become a TestSuite by
	its own (client/JFTP_AllTests.php) divided into separate testcases
	for each "feature", i.e.
	- connection
	- filesystem I/O
	- permissions
	- upload
	- download
	- commands
	- ...
	Ideas?
	PS: provided AllTests work :)

3	testSetOptions()
	Should we also test non-existing values, e.g. a string for the timeout?

4	testChmod()
	can we maybe even supress these errors in JFTP? Would probably better
	if the user does not see such a notice/warning.
	Return code from chmod should be enough...

5	use UnitTestHelper::log() for "informational" test results rather than
	sendMessage() to not populte TestCase output.
	Call ONE sendMessage() via JFTPTestHelper::tearDownTestCase() to tell
	the user there are some notes waiting in the log ;)

6	testSyst()
	Response from FileZilla 0.9.21: 215 UNIX emulated by FileZilla
	will other servers also "emulate"? if so accept emulation as passed
	OR accept response code 215/21x
