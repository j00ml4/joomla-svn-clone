		<p><b>Glossary</b><br>
        The glossary component was originally based on Arthur Konze's 
		Akobook Guestbook component and on the Weblinks component. It has
		subsequently been extensively modified by Martin Brampton, and 
		version 2.5 was a total rewrite, although retaining essentially the 
		same design.  Version 2.5 is the starting point for further development.
