Changes to make for multi-category feature:

Admin (All work is concentrated in com_content and com_categories (if necessary) until implementation is complete):
- DB Changes
-- Change catid field to accomodate a JSON string of ID's (done - 8Jul11)
- Single item view
-- Model
--- Change save function to convert the array of ID's to a JSON string for DB saving (done - 8Jul11)
-- Form
--- Change category field to allow multiple selections (done - 8Jul11)
- List view 
-- Model
--- Refactor getListQuery to create a replacement for the #__categories join (a separate query foreach catid post getListQuery, possibly optimized to look if that catid hasn't been queried?) NOTE - Ensure featured model is updated as well!
--- State processing to get the catid out of the JSON string when handling filters
- ACL Implementation
-- When edit/edit.state is allowed for multi-category articles (all or any?)

Front-end (All work is concentrated in com_content until implementation is complete):

// END TODO HERE, BEGIN RUNNING SQL CHANGES FOR A UPDATE FILE

ALTER TABLE `#__content` CHANGE `catid` `catid` varchar(255) NOT NULL default '0';
