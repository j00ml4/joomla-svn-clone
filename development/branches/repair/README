Repair Extension Suite
======================

The purpose of this extension suite is to have a toolset for repairing information in the Joomla schema.
Whether due to physical tampering, mistakes or bugs in the code, information tends to get out of whack
from time to time.  This component and set of plugins attempts to address a way to analyse and repair
information within the Joomla schema.

The methodology is to have an interface that can run test operations and then run repair operations.
Ideally automatic repair is the goal but sometimes information may be in such a state of disrepair
that only manual intervention is required.
