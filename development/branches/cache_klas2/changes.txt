Optimizations
* Filecache driver- spent most of it's time loading JFile and JFolder classes, 
	replaced those with new methods based on jfolder/jfile as cache is all about speed.
	One of the biggest gains is replacement of JFile::delete with php unlink
* Add JDocumentHTML->render caching - 50% speed gain compared to trunk JSite::render 
	or cca. 17% on overall performance
* Skip view cache if cache is off (3% performance gain on uncached sites)

Bugfixes
* Fix memcache test function to return false if memcached is not running
* Add option to skip pathway workaround - this was causing incorrect patway to appear with module cache
* Fix cache unit tests - the whole directory of cache tests now works ok
* Lock/unlock was missing in direct get and store (in JCacheController)
* eaccelerator_list_keys() is sometimes returning empty array, causing foreach to fail.. test is_array.
* Group was always empty in direct get and store (in JCacheController)
* Add language to cacheid for modules
* Add && $options[$option] !=='' to cache.php to preven empty value overwrite default one
