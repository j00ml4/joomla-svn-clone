INITIAL TASKS
- DONE: Fix cache admin to support all drivers, not just file cache
- DONE: Fix drivers  - implement missing functions: file(DONE), eacellerator(DONE), apc(DONE), xcache(DONE), memcache(DONE)

SMALLER TASKS
- DONE: Add standalone script with gc() call (to be used with crontab) 
- DONE: move _getCacheId method from drivers to storage for components
- DONE: replace getURI as cacheid base with safer cacheid creation methods
- DONE: set default cache options to values respecting configuration setting in JCache and remove them from JFactory::getCache
- DONE: remove duplicate options from cache plugin (use cachetime, handler etc., set in global configuration)
- DONE: (as sideeffect of previous 2 tasks) Fix cache plugin settings  http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_id=32&tracker_item_id=18669
- DONE: add cachelite driver
- DONE: move CacheItem from admin to framework JCacheStorageHelper
- DONE: add fixed wincache driver
- DONE: add addIncludepath to JCache and JCacheStorage, fix error if there is no pathway http://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-framework/browse_thread/thread/668a7088d00d66aa
- DONE: replace separate _expire files in file driver with timestamps (cca. 40% speed gain)
- DONE: change JFactory getFeedParser to use Joomla caching
- to do: Optimize gc in file cache driver (replace checking timestamps with accounting)

COMPLEX TASKS
- DONE: Implement advanced features: locking, corruption prevention NOT in the group mode to drivers
- DONE: Consolidate workarounds in new JCache methods, make them optional  (#18020, #19435) 
- DONE: Re-conceptualize view cache (and review/change other handlers if needed)
- DONE: Re-conceptualize module cache (move cache call to within the module, add module handler)
- DONE: make cache handlers independent of JCache, add JCacheHandler as parent class

- IN PROGRESS: Implement changed caching in core components DONE: com_content, com_weblinks, com_contact, com_newsfeeds, com_wrapper, com_banners
				and modules: DONE: mod_relateditems, mod_menu, mod_banners (via component query)
- IN PROGRESS: Test and cleanup changed files
- IN PROGRESS: Implement changed caching on framework level: DONE: JComponentHelper::_load(), JModuleHelper::_load()
- Additional caching and speed optimizations of core components/modules
