INITIAL TASKS
- DONE: Fix cache admin to support all drivers, not just file cache
- DONE: Fix drivers  - implement missing functions: file(DONE), eacellerator(DONE), apc(DONE), xcache(DONE), memcache(DONE)

SMALLER TASKS
- DONE: Add standalone script with gc() call (to be used with crontab) 
- DONE: move _getCacheId method from drivers to storage for components
- DONE: replace getURI as cacheid base with safer cacheid creation methods
- DONE: set default cache options respecting configuration in JCache and remove from JFactory::getCache
- DONE: remove duplicate options from cache plugin (use cachetime, handler etc., set in global configuration)
- DONE: (as sideeffect of previous 2 tasks) Fix cache plugin settings  http://joomlacode.org/gf/project/joomla/tracker/?action=TrackerItemEdit&tracker_id=32&tracker_item_id=18669
- DONE: add cachelite driver

COMPLEX TASKS
- Re-do all handlers as wrappers for callback. Consolidate workarounds in callback  (#18020, #19435, http://groups.google.com/group/joomla-dev-framework/browse_thread/thread/668a7088d00d66aa ..) 
- Re-conceptualize view cache (and review/change other handlers if needed)
- GENERALY WORKING, PROBABLY NEEDS FINETUNING: Re-conceptualize module cache (move cache call to within the module, add module handler)

- Implement changed caching in core components and modules
- Test and cleanup changed files
- Additional caching and speed optimizations of core components/modules
