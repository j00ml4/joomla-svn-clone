- DONE: Add standalone script with gc() call (to be used with crontab) 
- DONE: move _getCacheId method from drivers to storage for components
- DONE: replace getURI as cacheid base with safer cacheid creation methods

- Re-conceptualize view cache (and review/change other handlers if needed)
- GENERALY WORKING, PROBABLY NEEDS FINETUNING: Re-conceptualize module cache (move cache call to within the module, add module handler)

- Implement changed caching in core components and modules
