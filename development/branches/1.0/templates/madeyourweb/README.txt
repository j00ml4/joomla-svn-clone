
*** Mambo Template "madeyourweb" Readme ****

--INSTRUCTIONS--

1. Install as a usual mambo template.

2. In your template folder you find a file called "template_configuration.php". Open it with an editor, here you can change:

- the color (possible values: blue, red, green)
- the width of the right column, and with that the width of the modules in this column
  (possible values: normal, broad)
- the desired screen resolution (800 or 1024)
  
3. Possible issues with Internet Explorer

- If the right column goes under the main content sometimes, try to decrease the width of the values "maincol-*" in the CSS, 
  belonging to your settings (width/screen).
- Known issue: In the news overview the table is too wide for the main column when right modules set to "broad" and screen resolution to "800". 
  There you have to disable one of the filters (in the menu item parameters which points to this overview) , becauses these 
  are displayed inline and are too wide if displayed all.

Have fun!
