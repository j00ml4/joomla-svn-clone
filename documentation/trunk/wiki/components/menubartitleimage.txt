====== Using a custom image in the Menu Bar title ======

To use a custom image in the Menu Bar title we need an image (obviously) and a little bit of css.

First off, create the following folders in your administrator component (we're using a ficticious component called com_notes as the example).  Then place your image in the ''images'' folder and create a new file called ''default.css'' in the css folder, like this:

<code|Folder Structure>
com_notes
|- assets
..|- css
....|- default.css
..|- images
....|- logo.png
</code>

The code for the css file looks like this:

<code|default.css>
/* Toolbar */

.icon-48-notes {
    background: url(../images/logo.png) no-repeat left;
}
</code>

Next we tell the menubar handler function to use this css by the following invocation of the ''title'' method of ''JMenuBar'':

<code>
JMenuBar::title( JText::_( 'Notes List' ), 'notes' );
</code>

Notice that value of the second argument, ''notes'', marries with the suffix of the css class.

Finally we need to load the component custom css file.  Place the following code typically near the top of ''admin.notes.php'':

<code>
$document =& JFactory::getDocument();
$document->addStyleSheet('/components/com_notes/assets/css/default.css');
</code>

You can, of course, use ''default.css'' for more than just the title styling.
