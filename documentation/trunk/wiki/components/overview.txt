====3. Components====
Components are the main functional units that display in your template, like the content management system, contact forms, Web Links and the like. They are usually displayed in the center of the main content area of a template (depending on the template).

This chapter serves to provide you with a number of useful examples that help you to learn how to create your components.

While we have gone to great lengths to make Joomla easy for content providers to use, we have equally spent a lot of time developing a flexible framework for developers to extend the capabilities of Joomla without having to touch the Core code.
