====== TEST Welcome to the Joomla! Development Wiki ======


The Joomla! project has several working groups that have been created to utilise the wealth of knowledge our community provides. Each of these groups focuses on a specific aspect of Joomla! essential to the project's growth and development.


The working groups use the wiki to draft information sheets, howto's and general information related to their activities.  Only working group members have write access on the wiki. 

More information about the working groups can be found [[http://dev.joomla.org/content/view/13/53/|here]]. \\ \\

==== 1. Standards  ====

Joomla! follows some common standards (Zend and phpDocumentor) for coding.  To make your addons more readable it is recommended that you follow these standards too. To learn more about our Standards visit our [[standards:start|Standards Summary]]\\ \\
Many of these standards are in development and are still being improved. But make sure that your extensions use at least the minimal standards as it will improve the quality of your extensions and thus the Joomla! framework as a whole.
