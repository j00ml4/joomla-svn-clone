Constructs the JPaneSliders class, adding the necessary CSS and JS to the current document. The parent constructor is called. The method then will check to see if the JPaneSliders class has already been used. If it has not, then it will add links to the CSS and JavaScript files to the head tags of the document.

===== Syntax =====
JPaneSliders __construct ( **$params** )

| **$params** | array | is an associative array of values containing settings for the sliders. None of these settings are currently used. |

===== Examples =====
The [[JPane-getInstance|JPane::getInstance]] method calls the constructor in the following manner (where $behavior is 'Sliders' for a slider pane):
<code php|Example>
$classname = 'JPane'.$behavior;
$instance = new $classname($params);
