====== __construct ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Installer JInstaller::__construct #}

Constructor for the JInstaller class. Stores a reference to a database object (usually the Joomla! global database object).

===== Syntax =====
JInstaller __construct	( **&$db** )

| **$db** | object | is an object of type JDatabase. This is a database connector object that the class uses to manipulate the database. |

===== Examples =====
The constructor of this abstract base class should not be called directly. The getInstance method creates an object of the appropriate child class based on the package type. The base constructor is then called.
If $type is the type of extension that is contained in the package:
<code php|Example>
jimport('joomla.installer.installer.'.$type);
$adapter = 'JInstaller'.$type;
$instances[$signature] = new $adapter ($db);
</code>
instantiates the child class which calls this constructor.
