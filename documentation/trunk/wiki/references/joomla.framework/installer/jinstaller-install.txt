This is an abstract install method which must be overriden in the child class. If the function of the base class is called, the die function will be called specifying that the method is not available. In child classes, this method is responsible for performing the installation as specified in the package XML file by copying the appropriate files (creating directories if necessary), performing any necessary database updates, and performing any other actions that are required for extension installation.

===== Syntax =====
void install ()

===== Examples =====
This base class method should not be invoked. See the appropriate child class for information on invoking this method.
