====== toString ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Base JObject::toString #}

Object-to-string conversion. This function is empty and can be redefined by subclasses.

===== Syntax =====
string toString ()

===== Examples =====
In the base class, this function returns the name of the class to which the object belongs.
<code php|Example>
$object = new JObject();
echo $object->toString();
</code>
Might produce:
<code php|Result>
jobject
</code>

Note: In PHP 4 get_class() returns a user defined class name in lowercase, but in PHP 5 it will return the class name in it's original notation.

In PHP 5 the above example would produce:
<code php|Result>
JObject
</code>
