{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Document JDocument::getInstance #}

This function returns an object that is of a type that is dependent on the document type. The default document type is html. Currently this is the only type that has been implemented.

This method must be invoked as:
    $document = &JDocument::getInstance();
===== Syntax =====
jdocument &getInstance	( **$type**, **$attributes** )
| **$type** | type | is a string containing the type of document to instantiate. |
| **$attributes** | mixed | is an associative array containing the attributes to pass to the [[jdocument#__construct|class constructor]]. See [[jdocument#__construct|__construct]] for more information. |

===== Examples =====
This function is called from the [[references:joomla.framework:application:japplication#getDocument|JApplication::getDocument]] function and should not need to be called otherwise. This function is called in the following way:
<code php|Example>
$attributes = array (
                     'charset'  => 'utf-8',
           	     'lineend'  => 'unix',
                     'tab'  => '  ',
          	     'language' => 'en-GB'
		    );
jimport('joomla.document.document');
$instance =& JDocument::getInstance('html', $attributes);
</code>
This results in an object of type JDocumentHTML being assigned to the $instance variable.
