====== __construct ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Parameter JElement::__construct #}

This is the class constructor. It stores a reference to the JParameter object that instantiated it. The constructor is usually only called by the child class as this is an abstract class.

===== Syntax =====
JElement __construct	( **$parent** )

| **$parent** | JParameter | is a JParameter object which should be the object that is instantiating the element. This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to null. |

===== Examples =====
The JParameter::loadElement() method instantiates a JElement child class object in the following way:
<code php|Example>
$this->_elements[$signature]	= new $elementClass($this);
</code>
where $elementClass is the name of the appopriate class to use to render the given parameter. In the core API, most child classes of JElement do not implement the constructor and so this constructor is invoked directly upon instantiation.
