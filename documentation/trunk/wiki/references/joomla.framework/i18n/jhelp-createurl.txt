====== createURL ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework I18N JHelp::createURL #}

Creates a URL for a given help file reference. The URL returned from this method is dependent on a number of variables. The help URL can be set as a global configuration variable. In addition, a user specific help url can also be specified in the user manager. This allows a user's help site to be managed based on their specific language or locale.

The URL is determined based on the following priorities:
  - If the $com parameter is true, the help URL is returned based on the path to the component's help directory.
  - If the user's **helpsite** parameter is set, the URL is returned based on the user's specific help site. In addition, the JVersion->getHelpVersion() method is called and this value is appended to the end of the URL. The JVersion::getHelpVersion() method returns the current release with the '.' removed (so for Joomla! 1.5, it returns .15).
  - If the global helpsite parameter is set, the URL is returned based on this parameter. In addition, the JVersion->getHelpVersion() method is called and this value is appended to the end of the URL. The JVersion::getHelpVersion() method returns the current release with the '.' removed (so for Joomla! 1.5, it returns .15).
  - Otherwise, the URL is constructed based on the global live site parameter with '/administrator/help/en-GB/'. $ref .'.html' appended to it.

See the examples below to see the various scenarios.

===== Syntax =====
void createURL	( **$ref**, **$com** )
| **$ref** | string | is a string containing the name of the popup file (excluding the file extension for an xml file). |
| **$com** | boolean | is a flag which specifies whether or not to use the help file in the component directory. |

===== Examples =====
Use the help file which is located in the component directory:
<code php|Example 1>
jimport( 'joomla.i18n.help' );
echo JHelp::createURL( 'screen.config', true );
</code>
might produce:
<code php|Result 1>
http://127.0.0.1/joomla11/administrator/components/com_testing/help/screen.config.html
</code>

When it is defined, the method will use the user help URL (found in $user->getParam( 'helpsite' ) ):
<code php|Example 2>
jimport( 'joomla.i18n.help' );
echo JHelp::createURL( 'screen.config' );
</code>
might produce:
<code php|Result 2>
http://www.joomla-bg.com/help/index2.php?option=com_content&task=findkey&pop=1&keyref=screen.config.15
</code>
if the user is set to use the Bulgarian help site.

If the user does not have a help site URL defined, it will check for a global help url (using $mainframe->getCfg( 'helpurl' )):
<code php|Example 3>
jimport( 'joomla.i18n.help' );
echo JHelp::createURL( 'screen.config' );
</code>
might produce:
<code php|Result 3>
http://help.joomla.org/index2.php?option=com_content&task=findkey&pop=1&keyref=screen.config.15
</code>
if the user does not have a selected help site (or the user is not logged in).

If none of the above conditions are met:
<code php|Example 4>
jimport( 'joomla.i18n.help' );
echo JHelp::createURL( 'screen.config' );
</code>
might produce:
<code php|Result 4>
http://127.0.0.1/joomla11/administrator/help/en-GB/screen.config.html
</code>
