====== load ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework I18N JLanguageHelper::load #}

Loads a single language file and appends the results to the existing strings. This method will not load the same language file a second time. This will cause problems if you instantiate two objects using the same language pack. This method returns true on success, false otherwise.

===== Syntax =====
void load ( **$suffix**, **$basePath** )

| **$suffix** | string | is a string containing the suffix to be added the language file. |
| **$basePath** | string | is a string containing the base path in which to search for the language file. This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to JPATH_BASE. |

===== Examples =====
<code php|Example>
$english = JLanguage::getInstance( 'en-GB' );
echo "The language file for com_poll was " . ($english->load( 'com_poll' ) ? "" : "not") . " successfully loaded.";
</code>
might produce:
<code php|Result>
The language file for com_poll was successfully loaded.
