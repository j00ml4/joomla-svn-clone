====== __construct ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Session JTableUser::__construct #}

The class constructor calls the parent constructor to attach a JDatabase object to itself and to define its table name and primary key. It also sets the id and gid properties to 0.

===== Syntax =====
JTableUser __construct	( **&$db** )

| **&$db** | [[JDatabase|JDatabase]] | is a database connector object. |

===== Examples =====
The JTableUser class should be instantiated in the following way:
<code php|Example>
$user =& JTable::getInstance( 'user' );
</code>
The [[JTable-getInstance|JTable::getInstance]] method will load the file containing the class definition and instantiate the object with the specified database connector object.
