Add a directory where JTable should search for table types.

You may either pass a string or an array of directories. This is a static method and thus JTable does not need to be instantiated to use it.

These paths are used by the [[jtable-getinstance|JTable::getInstance]] method to load table class definition files.

This method returns the array of paths that have been added, thus this method is used not only to add paths but also to retrieve the list of paths that have been added.

===== Syntax =====
array addIncludePath	( **$path** )
| **$path** | mixed | is either a string containing the path that should be added to the search path list or an array of strings containing paths to search. This parameter is optional and if omitted defaults to null. |

===== Examples =====
<code php|Example>
print_r( JTable::addIncludePath( '/var/www/trunk' ) );
</code>
might produce
<code php|Result>
Array ( [0] => /var/www/trunk/libraries/joomla/database/table [1] => /var/www/trunk )
</code>
