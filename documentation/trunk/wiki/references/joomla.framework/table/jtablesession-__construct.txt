====== __construct ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Session JTableSession::__construct #}

The class constructor calls the parent constructor to attach a JDatabase object to itself and to define its table name and primary key. This method initializes the guest property to 1, the username to an empty string and the gid to 0.

===== Syntax =====
JTableSession __construct ( **&$db** )

| **&$db** | [[JDatabase|JDatabase]] | is a database connector object. |

===== Examples =====
The JTableSession class should be instantiated in the following way:
<code php|Example>
$session =& JTable::getInstance( 'session' );
</code>
The [[JTable-getInstance|JTable::getInstance]] method will load the file containing the class definition and instantiate the object with the specified database connector object.
