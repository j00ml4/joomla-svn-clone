Publishes or unpublishes the specified records.

This method will update the database records specified by $cid with the specified value of $publish. If the table has a checked_out field, then only records that are not checked out or are checked out by the user specified in $user_id will be updated. If only one record is specified, then the record will also be checked in.

The method returns true on success, false otherwise.

If no records are specified, then error number 24 will be set.
