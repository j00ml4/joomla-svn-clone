{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Session JSession::close #}

Writes session data and ends session<p>Session data is usually stored after your script terminated without the need  to call JSession::close(),but as session data is locked to prevent concurrent  writes only one script may operate on a session at any time. When using  framesets together with sessions you will experience the frames loading one  by one due to this locking. You can reduce the time needed to load all the  frames by ending the session as soon as all changes to session variables are  done.</p>
