Writes session data and ends session<p>Session data is usually stored after your script  terminated without the need to call JSession::stop(),  but as session data is locked to prevent concurrent  writes only one script may operate on a session at any time.  When using framesets together with sessions you will  experience the frames loading one by one due to this  locking. You can reduce the time needed to load all the  frames by ending the session as soon as all changes  to session variables are done.</p>
