{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JApplication::login #}

Checks a users login credentials and logs in if possible. The Username and encoded password are passed to the onLoginUser event which is responsible for the user validation. A successful validation updates the current session record with the  users details. The Username and Password are sent as credentials (along with other possibilities) to each observer (JAuthenticatePlugin) for user validation. 

Successful validation will  update the current session with the user details. This method rarely gets called directly since the $mainframe object is actually of type JSite, which extends JApplication. This child class overrides the login method. If either $username or $password evaluate to false, then these values are retrieved from the username and password variables as specified in the POST array. The child class then calls this parent method.

This method returns true of authentication was successful, false otherwise.

===== Syntax =====
boolean login ( **$username**, **$password** )

| **$username** | string | is a string containing the username of the user to be authenticated. |
| **$password** | string | is a string containing the password of the user to be authenticated. |

===== Examples =====
This method might be called as follows:
<code php|Example>
global $mainframe;
if ($mainframe->login( 'userbob', 'randompassword' )) {
    echo "Authentication successful! User logged in.";
} else {
    echo "User could not be logged in.";
}
</code>
might produce
<code php|Result>
Authentication successful! User logged in.
</code>
