====== setModel ======{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JView::setModel #}

Adds a model to the view.  The system supports a multiple model single view system by which models are referenced by classname.  A caveat to the  classname referencing is that any classname prepended by JModel will be referenced by the name without JModel, eg. JModelCategory is just Category.

The method returns a reference to the JModel object that was added to the view.

===== Syntax =====
JModel &setModel ( **&$model**, **$default**, **$model** )

| **$model** | JModel | is the JModel object to add to the view. |
| **$default** | boolean | is a boolean value that specifies whether or not the added model should be made the default model. |

===== Examples =====
The setModel method could be called in the following way from within the JController class:
<code php|Example>
// Push a model into the view
$model	= &$this->getModel( $viewName );
if (!JError::isError( $model )) {
	$view->setModel( $model, true );
}
