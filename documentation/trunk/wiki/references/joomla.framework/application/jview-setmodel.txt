====== setModel ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JView::setModel #}

Method to add a model to the view.  We support a multiple model single<p>view system by which models are referenced by classname.  A caveat to the  classname referencing is that any classname prepended by JModel will be  referenced by the name without JModel, eg. JModelCategory is just  Category.</p>

===== Syntax =====

| **$model** | object | The model to add to the view. |
| **$default** | boolean | Is this the default model? |
| **&$model** |  |  |
