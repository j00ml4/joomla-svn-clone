====== getItemid ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JApplication::getItemid - IR #}

The getItemid method accepts as its parameter an article id number and finds a menu item that the article falls under.

**The method is deprecated** and provided for backwards compatibility with Joomla! 1.0. It is scheduled to be removed in future versions.
Use [[JApplicationHelper-getItemid|JApplicationHelper::getItemid]] instead.

The Itemid that is used in Joomla! is (or at least should be) used only for menu items. The getItemid method serves as a bridge between articles and the menu.

This is a legacy function. It will be noted that there are six parameters documented here. In Joomla! 1.5, only the first one is used.

This method returns the Itemid of the specified article.

===== Syntax =====
void getItemid	( **$id**, **$typed**, **$link**, **$bs**, **$bc**, **$gbs** )

| **$id** | integer | is an integer containing the article id to be resolved. |
| **$typed** | boolean | is a boolean value that is unused. In previous versions, it was used to indicate that this item may be static content. |
| **$link** | boolean | is a boolean value that is unused. In previous versions, it was used to indicate that this item may be a link. |
| **$bs** | boolean | is a boolean value that is unused. In previous versions, it was used to indicate that this item may be a blog section. |
| **$bc** | boolean | is a boolean value that is unused. In previous versions, it was used to indicate that this item may be a blog category. |
| **$gbs** | boolean | is a boolean value that is unused. In previous versions, it was used to indicate that this item may be a global blog section. |

===== Examples =====
Using the default sample data, the following code:
<code php|Example>
global $mainframe;

echo $mainframe->getItemid( 6 );
</code>
might output
<code php|Result>
50
</code>
The parameter 6 that is passed to the getItemid method is the id of an article. In the sample data provided with Joomla! 1.5, the article with id 6 is the article titled, "We are Volunteers". The Itemid for this article would be 50 because the //first menu item// from which this article can be accessed from is the 'The News' menu item, which has the Itemid 50.
