====== __construct ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JController::__construct #}

The class constructor performs the necessary tasks to instantiate the controller.

This involves the following steps:
  * initialize private variables
  * determine the methods to be mapped to tasks by detecting which methods do not exist in the base JController class
  * register the default task
  * set the default model search path
  * set the default view search path

===== Syntax =====
JController __construct	( **$config** )

| **$config** | array | is an optional associative array of configuration settings. Recognized key values include 'name', 'default_task', 'model_path', and 'view_path' (this list is not meant to be comprehensive). |

===== Examples =====
A controller is often instantiated in the component entry point (the admin.component.php or component.php file, where component is the name of the component). This might be done in the following way:
<code php|Example>
$controller = new BannersController( array('default_task' => 'click') );
