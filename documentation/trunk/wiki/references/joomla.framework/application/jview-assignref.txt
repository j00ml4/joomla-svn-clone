====== assignRef ======
{#JAPI Joomla.Framework Application JView::assignRef #}

Assigns a variable to the view by reference.

Variables should generally be assigned by reference if they are objects or complex data types.  This saves on memory.

The method will not permit data to be assigned to properties that begin with an underscore because these are either private properties for JView or private variables within the template script itself.

The first parameter is the name of the variable to assign and the second parameter is the value.

This method returns true of the variable was successfully assigned, or false otherwise.


===== Syntax =====
boolean assignRef ( **$key**, **&$val** )

| **$key** | string | is a string containing the name for the reference in the view. |
| **&$val** | mixed | is the referenced variable. |

===== Examples =====
<code php|Example>
$view->assignRef( 'var1', $refObject );
</code>
The object can later be accessed using:
<code php>
$view->var1
</code>
