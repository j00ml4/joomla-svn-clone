The JTableComponent class is an implementation of the JTable class to provide access to the components table. This implementation provides data verification functionality via the check() method, the ability to load a row by its option field via the loadByOption() method and defines the class variables to provide an interface to the database table. It also implements a specialized bind() method to facilitate component configuration parameters.

The components table is used to manage the components that are installed in the local Joomla! system. There is one entry in this table per administrator menu entry.
