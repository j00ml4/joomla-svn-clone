Route the application.

Routing is the process of examining the request environment to determine which component should receive the request. This component optional parameters are then set in the [[references:joomla.framework:Environment:JRequest|request object]] to be processed when the application is being [[JApplication-dispatch|dispatched]].

The default implementation of this method instatiates an instance of [[references:joomla.framework:Environment:JURI|JURI]] and passes it to the JRouter. 

See [[JApplication-dispatch:dispatch()]].

<code php|Implementation>
class MyApp extends JApplication
{
  function route()
    $router =& $this->getRouter();
    $router->parse('/example/uri/display/foo:bar');
  }
}
</code>

<code php|Application>
$myApp =& new MyApp;
$myApp->route();
</code>
