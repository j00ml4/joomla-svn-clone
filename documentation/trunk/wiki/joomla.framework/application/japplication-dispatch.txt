Dispatch the application.

Dispatching is the process of pulling the option from the [[references:joomla.framework:Environment:JRequest|request object]] and mapping them to a component. If the component do not exist, it handles determining a default component to dispatch.

The default implementation of this method does nothing.
Subclasses should reimplement this method if they provide dispatching capabilities.
