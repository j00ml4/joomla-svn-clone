Register (map) a task to a method in the class.

This method does not need to be invoked for methods in the derived class as they are automatically registered by the constructor. It is only required when a task should be registered for which a method does not exist. This is commonly done to map multiple tasks to one method.

This method is generally invoked from the constructor of the derived class.

===== Syntax =====
void registerTask	( **$task**, **$method** )
| **$task** | string | is a string containing the task to be mapped. |
| **$method** | string | is a string containing the name of the method that should be executed for the specified task. |
===== Examples =====
<code php|Example>
$this->registerTask( 'add'  , 	'edit' );
</code>
will result in the edit() method of the derived controller class being executed when the add task is fired.
