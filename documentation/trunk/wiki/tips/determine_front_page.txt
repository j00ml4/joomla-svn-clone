======How to determine if the user is viewing the front page======

In Joomla! 1.0.x it was possible to determine if the user was viewing the front page by using code like this:

<code php|Determine if user is viewing the front page in Joomla! 1.0.x>
<?php
if ($option == 'com_frontpage') {
	echo 'This is the front page';
}
?>
</code>

But in Joomla! 1.5.x the com_frontpage component is no longer present.  This is how to achieve the same result in Joomla! 1.5.x

<code php|Determine if user is viewing the front page in Joomla! 1.5.x>
<?php
if (JRequest::getVar('view') === 'frontpage') {
	echo 'This is the front page';
}
?>
</code>
