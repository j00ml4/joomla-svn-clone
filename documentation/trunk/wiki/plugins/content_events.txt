===5.5.4 onPrepareContent===
==5.5.4.1 Description==
This is the first stage in preparing content for output and is the most common point 
for content orientated plugins to do their work. Since the article and related parameters 
are passed by reference, event handlers can modify them prior to display.
==5.5.4.2 Parameters==
  *article A reference to the article that is being rendered by the view.
  *params A reference to an associative array of relevant parameters. The view determines what it considers to be relevant and passes that information along.
  *limitstart An integer that determines the "page" of the content that is to be generated. Note that in the context of views that might not generate HTML output, a page is a reasonably abstract concept that depends on the context.
==5.5.4.3 Return Value==
None. Results are returned by modifying the referenced arguments.
