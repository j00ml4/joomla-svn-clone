====== Templates ======
A template is an extension that puts a certain look and feel on your site. With a template you can change the layout, palette and overall user experience for your site. Templates have placeholders which are filled in with the output from modules and components. They also have their own CSS files and image directories to provide maximum flexibility in how you style your site.

===== Template Tutorial Fragments =====
The links below are not intended to be read as a tutorial.  Rather they are links to pages which form a repository of "fragments" of documentation that can be used to assemble such things as tutorials, presentations, and so on.  This technique is known as "modular documentation" (not to be confused with Joomla! modules).

==== Primary fragments ====
  * [[fragments:definition lists|Definition lists]]
  * [[fragments:glossaries|Glossaries]]
  * [[fragments:procedures|Procedures]]
  * [[fragments:processes|Processes]]
  * [[fragments:topics|Topics]]
  * [[fragments:troubleshooting-scenarios|Troubleshooting scenarios]]

==== Secondary fragments ====
  * [[fragments:examples|Examples]]
  * [[fragments:figures|Figures]]
  * [[fragments:itemised-lists|Itemised lists]]
  * [[fragments:notes|Notes]]
  * [[fragments:tables|Tables]]
