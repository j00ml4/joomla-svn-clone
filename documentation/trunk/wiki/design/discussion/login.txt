DESCRIPTION #login
The Component needs <a name="login"></a> after the headline, because than the page starts not at the beginning,but at this anker. It's important for screenreader-users, bec√°use screenreaders start reading every time at the beginning of the page. If we use the anker, it's more easy for them, because they come direct to the content .
The legend is important because yaws-users can jump from legend to legend, if the are in form-mode

Ok, good points regarding the anchor and the legend

This is the module and the anchor should named modlogin. If anyone has placed the module on all pages and choose the login-component we have the login anchor twice
