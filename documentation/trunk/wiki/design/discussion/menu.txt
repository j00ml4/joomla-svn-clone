<div class="content-module"> is to much 
If somebody need  class it's better to use:

<ul class="menue">
If the active  li is a blog_contentsection or blog_contentcategorie, we need to make the link active, only when we have a link_content_item we have to use
<li class="active">
We can not use the class=" active", because active is used by the CSS syntax.
I think it's better to you  use class="selected".

Actually <div class="content-module"> is part of the standard module rendering.  This keeps things consistent between all modules and provides a handle to get at the body of the module.  not every module has something as convenient as <ul> surrounding the body.  I agree we can use selected in both <li> and <a> links to indicate active path.

Actually thinknig about it more and remembering my past experiences, its better that we have the class in the <li> tag so that allows more styling options.

You don't need <span class="invisible">.</span> inside a list (ul,ol,dl). Since it's in a list it conforms to 10.5 of WCAG 1.0/2.0.

I'll revise another edition of this code and post above. Any links outside a list may require something like <span class="invisible">.</span>, but not inside it

Ok good to know, it seemed a little ungainly with the extra tag.

The sound is better with this <span class=”invisible”>.</span> but it works without this. Compromise above.
