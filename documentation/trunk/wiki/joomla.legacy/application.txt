====== Application ======
This package contains legacy code that became **deprecated** with the advent of the Joomla! 1.5 Framework and is scheduled to be removed.

It is **not recommended** to utilize any of the following classes for extensions that aim to be compatible with Joomla! 1.5 or later. Support for these interfaces will be discontinued in future versions of Joomla!

The Joomla! 1.5 legacy classes are located in the following folder of your Joomla! installation:
  /libraries/joomla/common/legacy

The following list is provided as an entry point to the new MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern introduced in Joomla! 1.5.

For a full documentation of the legacy interface please refer to **Chapter 11. API Reference** of the [[http://help.joomla.org/content/category/12/108/125/|Joomla! 1.0 Developer Documentation]]

===== Summary =====
mosMainFrame is the base class for a Joomla! 1.0 application. It provides many basic API functions relating to the application itself.

An instance of this class, called ''$mainframe'', is created using the existing database object and the option parameter that was passed in the request. Therefore you do not generally need to create a new instance of this object.  If access to ''$mainframe'' is required within a function then it must be declared in a ''global'' statement at the top of the function so that the global variable is accessed.

''$mainframe'' is an instance of mosMainFrame for both the Joomla! 1.0 Front-end (Site) and Back-end (Administrator).
