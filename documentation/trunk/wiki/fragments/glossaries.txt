====== Glossaries ======

Glossaries are lists of technical terms and their explanations.  We may have multiple glossaries because we might select a subset of the terms available in the "master" glossary for a specific output document.  For now we'll just list all the terms that need defining here.

There is also a [[http://help.joomla.org/content/view/1607/214/|User Documentation Glossary]] available.

Please keep this list in alphabetical order.

  * CSS
  * HTML
  * module positions
  * PHP
  * template parameters
  * W3C
  * XHTML
  * XML
  * XML install file
