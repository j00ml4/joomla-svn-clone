====== Definition Lists ======

This page lists the definition lists which can be used as "fragments" in the documentation.  Definition lists are most commonly used to list components, so for example, we might create a definition list which lists the names of the principal files contained within a template and introduce the purpose of each.  These are primary fragments that can be included directly in the documentation.
