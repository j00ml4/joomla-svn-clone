  <title>HOWTO: Loading Extension Library Files</title>

  <para>One common extension task is to load library files. If your extension
  employs many class files then you may wish to put all of these files in a
  single libraries directory (as shown below).</para>

  <figure id="howto.loadextensionlibraryfiles.lqmlibrarystructure">
    <title>Directory Structure of Libraries Folder</title>

    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="images/lqmlibrarystructure.jpg" />
      </imageobject>
    </mediaobject>
  </figure>

  <para>To load my libraries I use a loader function that accepts a path
  argument in dot notation. This file can be defined in an include.php file
  that is included by anyone wishing to use the library.</para>

  <xi:include href="code/include.php.xml" />

  <para>It is important that you use a prefix to avoid name collisions in
  JLoader::import(). Perhaps the best prefix is the name of the extension (
  without the 'mod_' or 'com_' ). Don't use 'joomla' unless you want some
  angry emails from your users...!</para>

  <para>Once the include file has been loaded, you can do this.</para>

  <programlisting>lqmLibraryImport( 'variable.input.input' );</programlisting>

  <para>Because my function appends 'lqm.' to the path, I'm actually cheating
  a bit. The function jimport() would require you provide the library's path
  but then jimport() works with several libraries located under J/libraries.
  Your function would work with one - yours.</para>
