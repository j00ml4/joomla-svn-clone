  <title>HOWTO: Saving Form Data in Joomla! 1.5</title>

  <sect1 id="howto.savingformdata.safeway">
    <title>The Safe Way to Bind the Request Array to a JTable Object</title>

    <para>A common task when developing Joomla! components is saving data from
    a form into a table in the database. One method of doing so that is both
    save and easy is to process this data as follows:</para>

    <programlisting>$post = JRequest::get( ‘post’ );

// fix up special html fields
$post[‘description’] = JRequest::getVar( ‘description’, ‘’, ‘post’, ’string’, _J_ALLOWRAW );

$row =&amp; JTable::getInstance( ‘category’, $db );
if (!$row-&gt;bind( $post )) {
...</programlisting>

    <para>JRequest::get( ‘post’ ); 'get's an input filtered and slash
    corrected (slashes stripped where magic quotes are enabled) copy of the
    $_POST array. Because by default the array is filtered you loose any html
    tags in fields that were input using an editor. We must redefine those
    using JRequest::getVar and using the last option mark argument, in this
    case telling us we want the raw value posted.</para>

    <para>Following that we bind the JTable object to $post instead of
    $_POST.</para>

    <para>Doing things this way means:<simplelist>
        <member>your code is independant of magic quotes (that is, you can
        assume they are off and there are no unwanted slashes polluting your
        strings)</member>

        <member>your input is automatically filtered of many known
        nasties</member>

        <member>the is no risk of operating directly on the $_POST superglobal
        (which is generally a no-no)</member>

        <member>future creative exploits can be covered by a single upgrade to
        the JRequest class</member>
      </simplelist></para>

    <para>Using this technique, you can safely store data from the request
    into your database tables.</para>
