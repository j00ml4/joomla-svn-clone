===== {#JREF#} (planned) =====
This second tag is available to create internal links to another wiki page of the Joomla Framework **Ref**erence, and is helpful in writing the index (overview) page of a class with all its members.

The tag takes pretty much the very same arguments as JAPI (incl. their order) with the exception of the revision date and document status. Unlike %%{#JAPI#}%%, JREF only generates links that point to the wiki, including the icon for the "target", e.g. Package, Class, Method, and Constant.

Its defaults are however slightly different than those of JAPI if you ommit arguments. Since its focussed to link between members of the same //subpackage//, the package name can usually be ommited.


==== Examples ====
Passing one parameter:
  {#JREF JWhatever #}
{#JREF JWhatever #}
A class name located in the same (subpackage) folder: ''%%[[jwhatever.txt]]%%''

  {#JREF JWhatever::fooBar #}
{#JREF JWhatever::fooBar #}
A class member (method) located in the same (subpackage) folder: ''%%[[jwhatever-foobar.txt]]%%''

  {#JREF Joomla.Whatever #}
{#JREF Joomla.Whatever #}
A //package//: %%[[references:joomla.whatever]]%%

Passing two parameters:
  {#JREF Joomla.Whatever JWhatever::barBaz #}
{#JREF Joomla.Whatever JWhatever::barBaz #}
A class method located in some other package: ''%%[[references:joomla.whatever:jwhatever-barbaz.txt]]%%''
